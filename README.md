# ðŸ“Š Dicoding Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Dicoding Data Analysis Project**! ðŸš€ This is the final project I completed as part of the Dicoding Data Analyst learning path. Through this project, I developed a **Dicoding Collection Dashboard** to visualize and analyze key data insights.

ðŸŽ‰ **Live Dashboard**: [Check it out on Streamlit!](https://dashboard-dicoding-windaapriliyanti.streamlit.app/)

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

- **Platform**: Built with Python and deployed on Streamlit Community.
- **Purpose**: Visualize data insights, showcase analytical findings, and create an interactive experience.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Data analysis, data visualization, dashboard design, and deployment on Streamlit.

## ðŸŽ¨ What You'll See

âœ¨ A clean, interactive dashboard where you can explore and dive into data visualizations.

- **Data Visualizations**: Engage with charts, graphs, and tables that uncover meaningful insights.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate for both beginners and experienced users.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Toggle through various filters to customize the data view as per your needs.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Goals

This dashboard was designed to:
1. Showcase my data analysis skills.
2. Provide a platform to interactively explore the Dicoding Collection data.
3. Serve as a learning experience in deploying data projects online.
